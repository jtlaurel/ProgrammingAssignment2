## This is a function designed to cache the inverse of a
## matrix instead of calculating it each time.

## This is a function that creates a matrix that can 
## cache its inverse. 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function calculates the inverse of the matrix 
## returned by the function above. If the inverse has 
## been calculated, the inverse will be retrieved from 
## the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
